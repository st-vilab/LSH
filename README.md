**Advanced Diffusion Model for Image Reconstruction and Generation**

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for using diffusion models to reconstruct real images and generate new ones through advanced latent-space manipulations, using prompt-guided optimization and null-text techniques. The code includes detailed methods for bidirectional latent steps, embedding control, and noise prediction, allowing fine-grained control over image generation and reconstruction.
